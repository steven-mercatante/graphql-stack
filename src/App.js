            GraphQL is exciting, but its ecosystem can be confusing because of
            all the tools available. This chart is meant to help explain the
            various tools and how they fit in to the overall ecosystem.

          <h3>In case you don't know what GraphQL is...</h3>
          <p className="explanation">
            GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling
            those queries with your existing data. GraphQL provides a complete
            and understandable description of the data in your API, gives
            clients the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing
            more, makes it easier to evolve APIs over time, and enables powerful
            developer tools.

              This is where the business logic (e.g. user authentication, data
              processing) for your app traditionally lives. Common examples are
              Express apps, Django apps, Laravel apps, etc. They may also
              provide RESTful API endpoints (there's nothing saying you can't
              use GraphQL and REST in the same system.)
